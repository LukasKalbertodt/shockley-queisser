Calculate optimal band gap for photovolatic cells
=================================================

This is a tiny program which attempts to calculate the [Shockleyâ€“Queisser limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit) (or at least something close to it). I just wrote it for fun and uploaded it because... why not.

I initially thought this would be a fun (and surprisingly useful) programming task for people learning how to program. However, I noticed that it still involves quite a bit of physics and "wrapping your head around units", so it might not be an ideal task. Although, maybe you can prepare the data in the correct unit to make it easier. Not sure.
